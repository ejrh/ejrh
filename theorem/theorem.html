    <h1>Ideas on Mechanical Theorem Proving</h1>
    <address>Edmund Horner, c. Monday 14 April 2003.</address>
    
    <h2>Confession</h2>
    
    <p>
        (What I'm actually talking here is only very basic &quot;theorem
        proving&quot;.  It is probably better described as parse tree
        find-and-replace.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal with these ideas is to write a program that does things
        similar to theorem proving, i.e. substitues parse trees for
        equivalent parse trees.  Some points about the current program:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Written in C, though a higher-level language would have been
            a lot wiser (and less fun).  Also uses a YACC (Yet Another Compiler
            Compiler) grammar.  Has lots of memory leaks.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Fundamental data structure is a TREE.  Logical statements are
            represented as fairly simple trees.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Rules (or axioms) are also represented as trees.  One rule can
            be combined with one tree to create another tree.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            The first milestone for the program is to read statements and
            rules from a text file into trees; and to have methods for
            combining rules with trees; and to display trees (nicely).
        </li>
        
        <li>
            It doesn't matter if it picks rules at random and generates
            useless output.  But the output has to be correct.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Language</h2>
    
    <p>
        Here is an abridged version of the grammar:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
    file:
        empty
        | rule
        | file rule
        | expression
        ;
        
    rule:
        NAME COLON expression INTERCHANGES expression SEMI_COLON
        | NAME COLON expression BECOMES expression SEMI_COLON
        | BINARY NAME SEMI_COLON
        | POST NAME SEMI_COLON
        | PRE NAME SEMI_COLON
        | error SEMI_COLON
        ;
        
    expression:
        expression IMPLIES expression
        | expression EQUIVALENT_TO expression
        | expression CONTRADICTS expression
        | expression OR expression
        | expression AND expression
        | NOT expression
        | FOR_ALL variable expression
        | EXISTS variable expression
        | variable
        | expression BIN_OPERATOR expression
        | PRE_OPERATOR expression
        | expression POST_OPERATOR
        | L_PARAN expression R_PARAN
        ;
    
    variable:
        NAME
        ;
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        An input file can contain many rules (axioms).  An example of
        one rule, which shows that &quot;a &amp; b&quot; can be replaced with
        &quot;b &amp; a&quot; for any subexpressions a and b, is:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
        commute_and: a &amp; b => b &amp; a;
    </pre>
    
    <p>
        New kinds of operator can be declared.  Declaring them is
        necessary so that the parser can properly identify them as
        binary (an operand on either side), post-operand, or pre-operand.
    </p>
    
    <pre>
        binary -;
        post !;
        factorial: a! => a * (a - 1)!
    </pre>
    
    <h2>Application of Rules</h2>
    
    <p>
        This is the core of the program.  The ApplyRule function must
        return the correct expression given an expression, a rule,
        and a point to apply the rule; or signify an inability to
        do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some algorithms for ApplyRule, and the subordinate
        functions MatchRule, GenerateNewTree, and GenerateReplacementTree.
        These algorithms in their current form probably do not satisfy all of
        Donald Knuth's criteria (Finiteness, Definiteness, Input, Output,
        Effectiveness), but they are still called algorithms.
        
    </p>
    
    <h3>Algorithm: ApplyRule(<var>expr</var>, <var>rule</var>,
    <var>point</var>)</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preconditions: <var>expr</var> is an expression in tree form;
            <var>rule</var> is a rule in tree form (each side of the tree is
            an expression, and the root of the tree is the special
            <strong>BECOMES</strong> operation); <var>point</var> is
            a pointer to a subtree of <var>expr</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>pattern</var> be the left side of <var>rule</var>.
            Let <var>replacement</var> be the right side of <var>rule</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a new table, <var>matches</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check that the rule can be applied at this point, and build
            a table of names used in <var>point</var>:
            MatchRule(<var>matches</var>, <var>point</var>,
            <var>pattern</var>).
        </li>
        <li>
            If MatchRule returns negatively, then the rule can't be applied.
            Return.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate a new tree from <var>expr</var>, replacing <var>point</var>
            with <var>replacement</var>, using the subtrees in the <var>matches</var>
            table: GenerateNewTree(<var>matches</var>, <var>expr</var>,
            <var>point</var>, <var>replacement</var>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Postconditions: the algorithm returns the expression
            <var>res</var> in tree form. <var>expr</var> and <var>rule</var>
            are unchanged.
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Algorithm: MatchRule(<var>matches</var>, <var>target</var>,
    <var>pattern</var>)</h3>
    
    <p>
        This function is recursive.  Its exit condition is <var>pattern</var>
        being a name (and obviously having no children).
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preconditions: <var>matches</var> is a table inherited from
            the caller, to which the function adds any names found;
            <var>target</var> and <var>pattern</var> are trees representing
            a subtree of the equation to change, and the corresponding
            subtree of the rule.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the root of <var>pattern</var> is a name <var>name</var>, then:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Look up <var>name</var> in <var>matches</var>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the name wasn't found, then add <var>target</var>
                    to the table, using the key <var>name</var>.
                    Return positively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the name was found, compare corresponding
                    tree in the table with <var>target</var>.  If
                    they match, then return positively.  Otherwise
                    return negatively.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            If the root of <var>target</var> and the root of <var>pattern</var>
            don't match, then the rule doesn't match.  Return negatively.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>left_target</var> and <var>left_pattern</var> be the left
            sides of <var>target</var> and <var>pattern</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If MatchRule(<var>matches</var>, <var>left_target</var>,
            <var>left_pattern</var>) returns negatively, then also return
            negatively.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let <var>right_target</var> and <var>right_pattern</var> be the
            right sides of <var>target</var> and <var>pattern</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If MatchRule(<var>matches</var>, <var>right_target</var>,
            <var>right_pattern</var>) returns negatively, then also return
            negatively.
        </li>
        <li>
            Postconditions: If the rule matches, then <var>matches</var> is a
            table containing the subtrees in <var>point</var> that matched
            with variable names in <var>rule</var>, indexed by that name (this
            table will also contain names from other recursive invocations of
            MatchRule); the function returns negatively.  If the rule doesn't
            match, <var>matches</var> may or may not be changed and the function
            returns negatively.
        </li>
    </ol>
